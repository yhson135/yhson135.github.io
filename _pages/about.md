Hello! I'm **Young-Han Son**, currently conducting research at the Department of Artificial Intelligence, Korea University, as part of the Molecular AI Team.

My research focuses on **molecular optimization** for drug discovery and semiconductor design, as well as **optical physics**, particularly spectrometry and computational lithography. I‚Äôm especially interested in **optimization**, reinforcement learning for language models, and I am strongly interested in **physics-based modeling**.
I'm also supervising various medical AI projects, including research on brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and radiology.

Outside of research, I‚Äôm a coffee lover ‚òï ‚Äî I enjoy AeroPress and hand-drip brewing, and love exploring a variety of coffee beans.
